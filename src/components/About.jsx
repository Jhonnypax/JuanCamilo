        <h1>Let's talk a bit about me...</h1>
        <p>
          I didn't think I would end up studying coding. Since I was a child, I always dreamed of studying design. 
          I loved arts and drawing had always been my passion. However, that changed when I learned programming at school. 
          Programming was more than just... coding. 
          <br /><br />
          Two years before finishing school, I took programming as another branch for my studies. 
          That's why as soon as I finished school, I knew what I wanted to study. 
          "Programming" was the term I used without knowing how expansive and diverse that world is. 
          So I decided to take 1/2 years to study full-stack development. 
          There, I encountered <strong>UX design and front-end development which I decided would be my main interests.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Right now, I'm finishing my studies as a full-stack developer and of course, I'm not going to stop there. 
          I need to improve, learn, and explore even more if I want to do better.
